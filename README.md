# Baby-AT-Motherboard-Tray
Baby-AT Motherboard Tray - 3D Printable and CNC Machinable. Intended to be the basis of something bigger and better. Developed by "The R.A.T." Customizations MAY be available upon request. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) License: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ The design allows for the insertion of M3 bolts from the bottom allowing M3 nuts to be "stacked" to act as the standoffs. The larger holes are the standard Baby-AT holes and are 0.156" (3.9624mm) in diameter. The smaller holes are not part of the Baby-AT Standard and are 0.0940" (2.3876mm) in diameter. They fit a #6 Self-Tapping Screw but should probably NOT be used as they were included for my own experimental purposes. Finding information proved somewhat difficult with the included "jpeg/png" being the best that I could do. Anyone having a genuine pdf of the standard and emailing it to me would be greatly appreciated. Any information regarding errors also appreciated.
